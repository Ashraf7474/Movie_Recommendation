# Primary Objective

we aim to collect data on the top-rated movies from IMDb using web scraping techniques. We will then proceed to clean and preprocess this data for analysis. Subsequently, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the dataset. Finally, we will use the insights obtained to develop a movie recommendation system and create a web page to facilitate user movie searches based on their preferences.

Collect data on movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, and other relevant attributes.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent data.

Standardize data formats and units.

Remove duplicates and irrelevant information

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the distribution of movie ratings, genres, and release years.

Identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

Explore factors affecting movie ratings, such as genre or director.

# Movie Recommendation System

Develop a recommendation system using techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

Allow users to input their preferences (e.g., favorite genres, actors, Year , Certificate).

Recommend movies based on user input and historical IMDb data.

# Web Page Development

Create a user-friendly web page for movie searching and recommendations.

Implement an interface for users to input their preferences.

Display movie recommendations based on user input.

# Conclusion

By completing this project, we will not only collect and analyze data on top IMDb movies but also provide a valuable tool for users to discover and explore movies tailored to their preferences. The recommendation system and web page will enhance the user experience and provide actionable insights for the movie industry.
